## Why We're Building This

I've written hundreds of resumes—for myself, for colleagues, for mentees. Every time, the same pain points:

1. **Formatting nightmares** — Word corrupts layouts, PDFs don't export right
2. **Version chaos** — Which resume did I send to that company?
3. **Generic content** — Same bullet points sent to every job
4. **ATS rejection** — 75% of resumes never reach humans

The tools that exist are either:
- **Too simple** — Basic templates with no intelligence
- **Too expensive** — $20+/month for features you use once
- **Privacy nightmares** — Your career data stored on unknown servers

We're building the tool I wished existed: AI-powered, privacy-first, built on open standards, and free to use.

## Open Source Commitment

We believe career tools should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability to pay.
